# Polarized lightcurves from a magnetized orbitting spot

This dataset contains lightcurves for a spot toy model with polarimetric information.

The model involves a spot that orbits a Kerr black hole in its equatorial plane at a fixed radius. The spot is assumed to 
have a half-sphere shape and thus forms a 3D structure that is filled with an opticaly thin gas. 
It is threaded with a magnetic field which is vertical in the spot's comoving frame (perpendicular to equatorial plane). 
The gas in the spot radiates synchroton emission because of the magnetic field that is locally polarized according to the
oriantation of the magnetic field. For simplicity it is also assumed that the generated photons are 100% polarized.

## Data

The data tarball (lightcurves.tar.gz) contains individual polarized lightcurves, each for a specific set of parameters. 
Those parameters are described in the index file (index.dat).
